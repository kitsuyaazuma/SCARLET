Official implementation of SCARLET (Semi-supervised federated distillation with global CAching and Reduced soft-Label EnTropy)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `main` branch contains a simplified implementation for better understanding of SCARLETâ€™s core algorithms.
> For the exact experiment code and hyperparameter settings used in our paper, switch to the [`reproducibility`](https://github.com/kitsuyaazuma/SCARLET/tree/reproducibility) branch.
